#' Software failure data
#'
#' Software failure data (time data, grouped data) collected by John Musa and Yoshihiro Tohma
#'
#' The follwoing data are software failure data in real application, which was
#' collected by John Musa. The name without \code{g} (e.g. \code{sys1}, \code{sys2}) indicates
#' the interval time of failures in CPU time, and the last negative value
#' means the time in which there is no failure from the last failure. The name with
#' the suffix \code{g} (e.g. \code{sys1g}, \code{sys2g}) means the grouped fauilure data, i.e., the sequence
#' of the number of failures per woring day.
